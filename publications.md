##### Representation Learning and Others

P.S. we have another group led by A/Prof. Xin Li working on data mining, (deep) representation learning with applications to healthcare, social network analysis and recommender systems. We are also recruiting students to join us every year. For more details, please go to <a href="http://cs.bit.edu.cn/szdw/jsml/js/lixin/index.htm" > Xin's homepage@BIT </a>.  Here's our selected publications.
