##### Concept learning in minds and machines
_Key people: ..._

Human conceptual representations are rich in structural and statistical knowledge. Symbolic models excel at capturing compositional and causal structure, but they struggle to model the most complex correlations found in raw data. In contrast, neural network models excel at processing raw stimuli and capturing complex statistics, but they struggle to model compositional and causal knowledge. The human mind seems to transcend this dichotomy: learning structural and statistical knowledge from raw inputs.

We are developing neuro-symbolic models that learn compositional and causal generative programs from raw data, while using neural sub-routines for powerful statistical modeling (see diagram). We aim to better understand the dual structural and statistical natures of human concepts, and to learn neuro-symbolic representations for machine learning applications.

##### Compositional generalization in minds and machines
_Key people: ..._

People make compositional generalizations in language, thought, and action. Once a person learns how to "photobomb" she immediately understands how to "photobomb twice" or "photobomb vigorously."
