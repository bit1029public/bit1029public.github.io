##### About Our Group

Following the stunning success of AlphaGo, Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) combining deep learning and conventional reinforcement learning has emerged as one of the most competitive approaches for learning in sequential decision making problems. Besides, Deep Reinforcement Learning always links with advanced Mechine Learning theory, optimization theory and statistical theory, which set a higher request to the researchers in this field.

Driven/Inspired by many talented researchers, our **1029DRL** Group (led by [A/Prof. Xin Li](http://cs.bit.edu.cn/szdw/jsml/js/lixin/index.htm)) keep investigating the emerging DRL algorithms published in the top conferences, aim to create new methods for reinforcement learning that remove some of the limitations on its widespread application and try to develop our own to contribute to the RL community. We devote to developing a more explainable/sample-efficient/training-efficient/robust (D)RL algorithm with its application to single/multi-player games, robotics and healthcare.

We are located at the Room 1029 in Central Teaching Building. Our group is harmonious, friendly and enterprising. It is a pleasure if you want to join us.
