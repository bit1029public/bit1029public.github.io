##### About Our Group

Followed the stunning success of AlphaGo, Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) combining deep learning and conventional reinforcement learning has emerged as one of the most competitive approaches for learning in sequential decision making problems. Driven/Inspired by many talented researchers, our **1029DRL** Group (led by [A/Prof. Xin Li]) keep studying the emerging (Deep) RL algorithms published in the top conferences, and try to develop our own to contribute to the RL community. We devote to developing a more explainable/sample-efficient/training-efficient/robust (D)RL algorithm with its application to single/multi-player games, robotics and healthcare.
